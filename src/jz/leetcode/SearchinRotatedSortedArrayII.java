 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
 
Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":

What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

The array may contain duplicates.
